Upload file information needed for the URLs:

Do to vCenter not having all the calls needed as API we're going to use PowerShell. Meaning:
1. Need to get MS Core on linux: https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-6
2. Need to install the VMware PowerCLI to the Linux machine: http://nokitel.im/index.php/2018/03/01/installing-vmware-powercli-10-0-0-on-linux/
3. Document for API calls VMware (6.5/7) https://code.vmware.com/apis/366/vsphere-automation

Things that need to be run:
1. Creation of networks
2. Creation of DHCP server using the defined networks
3. Creation of a Domain Controller
4. Creation of the PC using the OVA upload???
5. Register PE to the PC
6. Upload OVA and ISO files to the Images Datastore/Storage Container
7. Assign Domain to the PE and PC
