Just created a dedicated environment so we don't have to rebuild every time:

Setup of the CentOS image server and GutHub staging VM
* Open SSH server is installed by default in the MiniServer of CentOS
    * http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1810.iso
* Installation of Git
    * Yum install git -y
* Remote Sublime connection so we can use human readable tools
    * https://acarril.github.io/posts/ssh-sripts-st3
* Nginx setup/installation
    * https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-centos-7
    * Disable SELINUX: https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/1150Docs/Installation+Guide+-+Disable+SELinux
